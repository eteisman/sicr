					&#8220;We share with other churches a concern for the poor, the homeless and uprooted, and work for a just and peaceful world.
					As part of the World Church we seek to work with and alongside our partners across continents and traditions, and share 
					with congregations in Scotland the joy of our unity in Christ.&#8221;

					Since the church was created at the same time as the Westminster Confession of Faith, our faith is rooted in the Protestant 
					and Reformed tradition. We believe in the sovereign grace of God, the truth of the Bible and the power of prayer.
					<div class="line-break"></div>
					We try to make space for people from different Christian traditions and to be an open and diverse 
					Christian community.
					In our church life, we seek excellence in five &lsquo;ships&rsquo;: Worship, Discipleship, Fellowship, Stewardship and Leadership.

					As far back as 1643 there was a need for a church for Scots people involved in the textile industry, military and sea-farers. 
					Since then many ordained ministers from Scotland have served here. After the church was destroyed by war bombardment in 1940, the 
					church of Scotland agreed to rebuild the &lsquo;Scots Kirk&rsquo; after the war.

					In 1996, the year the Erasmus bridge was completed, bringing together two sides of the city, our church adopted an international 
					identity to be a bridge to people of all cultures. On our gallery page you will find historic photos.
