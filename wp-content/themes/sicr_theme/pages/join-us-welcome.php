					We are an English language Protestant Church in the city centre of Rotterdam.
					The church was started for Scots people who had moved to The Netherlands in the seventeenth 
					century but today we have a much wider relevance to people from all over the world.
					We have a special appeal for those seeking an English language ministry and several people have 
					said that they learned the English-language while coming here!
					<div style="height: 10px;"></div>
					Many who are preparing to go overseas or come to The Netherlands from other lands find us to 
					be a like a spiritual bridge back to The Netherlands. 
					We also appeal to those who seek spiritual relevance that is recognizably Reformed or Protestant 
					but open to global and wider influences. 
					Our City-centre church draws a diverse congregation from across the south and west of The Netherlands. 
					Several descriptions come to mind for this English-speaking community... an old church with a new face... an 
					historic church with a renewed relevance...
					<div style="height: 10px;"></div>
					But most importantly as one of the hymns puts it:<span class="all-are-welcome">&lsquo;All are welcome in this place!&rsquo;</span>

					Our congregation was originally formed in 1643 from the large Scottish community of merchants, seamen and 
					soldiers then living in Rotterdam, hence the name.
					The church has now a truly international make up with people mainly from Europe, Africa, America and Asia.
					<div style="height: 8px;"></div> 
					We remain connected to the Church of Scotland through the Presbytery of Europe but we are also liaised to 
					the Dutch Reformed Church (PKN).
					<div style="height: 8px;"></div>
					We are based in the heart of the city, aiming to serve the needs of the people of many nationalities and 
					different denominational backgrounds living in Rotterdam, Delft, The Hague and other towns in the south-west 
					of The Netherlands, with many travelling a considerable distance to worship.
