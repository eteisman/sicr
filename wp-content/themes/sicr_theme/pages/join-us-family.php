					The Sunday Services from 10:30 a.m. to &plusmn; 12:00 noon are the mainstay of our ministry to adults.
					<div class="line-break"></div> 
					The service usually follows a regular pattern consisting of the Gathering, the Word, the Thanksgiving and the Sending.
					Prayers, songs and hymns, Bible readings, offering, announcements and benediction form part of this.
					<div class="line-break"></div>
					On special occasions, for example, at Easter or Easter, a Family Service is held 
					when children participate in the whole service, often taking an active role.
					<div class="line-break"></div>
					Remembrance Sunday takes place on the second Sunday in November and focuses on those who died in the two World Wars, as well 
					as during Peace keeping duties. A traditional Scottish piper and bugler are in church to play the &lsquo;Lament&rsquo; and 
					the &lsquo;Last Post&rsquo;.
					<div class="line-break"></div>  
					It has been a long tradition in the SICR to hold an International Peace Service on the evening of Remembrance Sunday.
					Ministers and choirs from other international or non-Dutch language churches in Rotterdam are invited to participate.
					<div class="line-break"></div>
					The Thomas (Mass) Prayers is a Service held several times a year, during which the congregation, after the sermon, 
					moves around several stations in the sanctuary where they can perform a symbolic act like lighting a candle, pray and 
					meditate.

					The Cr&egrave;che is a safe and warm place for children up to the age of three. 
					Parents, taking turns to watch over the children, are also able to hear the service - so they don&rsquo;t miss out.
					<div class="line-break"></div>
					The Cr&egrave;che is also a great way for parents of young children to meet one another!									
					If you are interested in helping to look after young children, contact Maaike van Eerden for details.
					<div class="line-break"></div>
					Our Child Protection Officer, Veronica Leerdam, screens all who take care of the infants, as well as those involved in the 
					Sunday School and Youth Group, in order to ensure proper safe guarding in line with Church 
					of Scotland regulations.

					Our Sunday School takes place every Sunday, except during July and August.
					<div class="line-break"></div> 
					Sunday School starts when the children come down from the Sanctuary to the Lower hall, after the Children&rsquo;s Message.
					<div class="line-break"></div>
					The Sunday School caters for children from three to eleven years of age in three age groups; three to four, five to seven and nine to eleven. 
					They are taught by a group of volunteer teachers, who are instructed, guided and coached by the Sunday School Superintendent 
					Olaf de Zanger. Highlights of the year are the Annual Sunday School Christmas party and the Picnic in the park.
