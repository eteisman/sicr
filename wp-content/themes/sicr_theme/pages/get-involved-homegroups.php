					Home Groups consist of SICR members, mostly living in the same area, who meet mostly once a month after the 
					Service in someone&rsquo;s home.
					Their activities consist of discussing sermons, religious or ethical topics, bible study and fellowship.
					<div class="line-break"></div>
					Various courses on relevant topics are organized, based on need, interest and availability.
					<div class="line-break"></div>
					The "Alpha Course", aimed at those who are not (very) familiar with Christianity, takes place at least once a year. 
					Various Bible study opportunities also exist. Other recent courses on offer were on Urban Ministry, Exploring 
					Christianity and Pastoral Counselling.
					<div class="line-break"></div>
					Please contact the Minister or one of the elders if you are interested in one of the courses or want to suggest 
					different topics.
