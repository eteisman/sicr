					If you want to bring your family up in the Christian faith, we recommend that you seek to have your 
					children baptized and seek the support of the church.
					
					In baptism of children, the parents (or grandparents) accept the prior claim of God upon their children 
					and enter into a spiritual covenant. This knowledge helps the whole community in their responsibility of nurture.

					We have a youth group for teenagers (12-18 years), Sunday school for children (3-12 years) and a cr&egrave;che (0-3 years).

					As a member of the church, you are part of a spiritual community that worships together every week and hosts 
					other activities as part of its work and witness in the city. We celebrate the sacrament of Communion or Lord&rsquo;s
					Supper on the first Sunday of the month. You are also entitled to vote at our Annual General Meeting in February or March.
					<div class="line-break""></div>
					If you are from another church, it is not necessary for you to give up your commitment to that congregation.<br/> 
					There may be many reasons (such as family tradition, temporary relocation, sudden change of life) for keeping up 
					that connection. We notice that people do not simply move from one country to another but keep connections in 
					several places at the same time.

					While you live in the Rotterdam area, you may want to commit yourself to this local English-speaking city-centre church.
					<div class="line-break""></div>
					Those not as yet baptized join the church by baptism and taking promises before the church.
					If you have been baptized but not yet made those promises, you may want to seek confirmation.
					If you have been a member of another church, we may accept you as a member by transference from that congregation. 
					You may join the church by public profession of faith.
					For a range of reasons and other circumstances, the elders may simply resolve you as a member of the church. 
					Please ask the minister for further advice.
					<div class="line-break""></div>
					The principal way that people are introduced to the Christian faith and church membership is in discipleship programmes 
					which usually take place as a series of evening discussions. They take different forms but currently we run the "Alpha 
					Course" every year. After a meal together there is a presentation of one aspect of the Christian 
					faith, followed by group discussion. Other courses include "Christianity Explored" and "Emmaus".
					You are strongly urged to consider making time for one of these courses.
